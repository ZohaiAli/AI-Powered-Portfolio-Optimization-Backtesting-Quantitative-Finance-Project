**AI-Powered Portfolio Optimization & Backtesting (Quantitative Finance Project)**

ðŸ“Š Description

This project implements an AI-driven portfolio optimization system that combines Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) with machine learning and reinforcement learning concepts to build, optimize, and backtest dynamic investment portfolios.

It automatically fetches real financial data using the Yahoo Finance API, applies Markowitz Efficient Frontier optimization for baseline allocation, and sets up a framework for training an AI agent to rebalance portfolios over time to maximize the risk-adjusted return (Sharpe Ratio).
